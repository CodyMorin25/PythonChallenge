## Project Overview
A Colorado Board fo Elections emplyee gave me certain tasks to complete inorder to complete the election audit fo a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate won.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data source = election_results.csv
- Results can be found at [election_analysis.txt](https://github.com/CodyMorin25/PythonChallenge/blob/main/analysis/election_analysis.txt)

## Summary
### Results
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 total votes cast in the election.
- Denver county had the largest voter turnout with a total of 306,055
- The candidates were:
     - Charles Casper Stockham
     - Diana DeGette
     - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candiate results were:
     - Charles Casper Stockham recieved 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
     - Diana DeGette recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
     - Raymon Anthony Doane recieved 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
- The winner of the election was Diana DeGette who recieved 73.8% of the vote and 272,982 number of votes.
- The voter turnout for each county:
     - Jefferson produced 10.5% of voter for a total of 38,855 voters.
     - Denver produced 82.8% of voters for a total of 306,055 voters.
     - Arapahoe produced 6.7% of voters fot a total of 24,801 voters.
- The county with the most voter turnout was Denver with 82.8% of voters for a total of 306,055 voters.

### Proposal
Expanding on the script to include the turnouts by counties with candadite results was a great way to give one insight on future elections. So one could properly allocate resources where the turnout was low or there were hard to reach demographics. We could even go farther and determine what percentage of each county voted for each candidate.
Also if you wanted to use the same script for federal elections, you would just switch county to states.
No matter how many candidates or counties, this script used to perform election audits will prove invaluabe to the board.
